<header> <h1>Establishing Self -Worth in Children</h1></br></br>

<p>As a preface to why I feel Sleeptalk for Children is an invaluable parenting tool, I would, perhaps, 
like to develop a partial picture of fundamental traits that I believe all parents would  like to 
see  their children possessing.</p>
</header>​
<p><h2>In my mind, a positive self - image is the foundation for a healthy productive life.​</h2>
A child who is suffering from a negative self-image does not know how ask for help with words. Their call 
for help normally comes in the form of behavioral  issues. These can range from withdrawing into themselves
to bullying, bedwetting to poor academics, poor social skills to drug addiction, just to name a few.​</p>
<main>
<p><h3>As parents and educators, we want to see our children possessing more than just a positive self-image.
</h3>
Our goal is to help them develop into upright, happy, loving, giving and productive people.​
To counter the constant attack of negative messages that daily barrage our children, our children require
a rock solid, bulletproof self-image of their intrinsic self - worth to empower them to honestly know 
and recognize their own strengths and weaknesses.​</p>

<p>They should have the fundamental belief that they are still “under construction” and be accepting of
themselves even when they make mistakes.​They should live with the credo that the goal in life is to work 
on making oneself as perfect as possible, and that learning from mistakes is part of the process.​ 
Our children should be emotionally stable when facing a lack of success, a disappointment, or somebody’s negative behavior or statements towards them; 
they must see these experiences as being external to themselves. They should view these experiences as
learning opportunities that aid them in improving themselves, checking and\or adjusting their moral compass 
or understanding the way another person of deals with frustration.​ While they are willing to learn and change 
based on lesson they have learned, these experiences must not stop them from accepting themselves for what 
they do correctly or diminish their self - worth.</p> ​
<p>Our children should possess an internal sense of security and confidence. This will allow them to take on new 
challenges, and to have the openness to hear and benefit from the ideas and experiences of others.​
 In the same way that they honestly know and recognize their own strengths and weaknesses and are accepting 
 of themselves, they should be able to see and appreciate the needs and/or the capabilities of others. They 
 should not feel any need to be happy at someone else’s misfortune nor have a fear of acknowledging that 
 someone is  able to do something better than they are able to do it.</P>
 ​<main/>
This tall order is actually attainable, and, surprisingly, doable, even in our fast paced and pressure 
filled world.​
It can be done in the privacy of one’s home, in full accordance with one’s religious and moral beliefs 
and values. It does not require any medication.​
It is the Goulding method of Sleeptalk for children.​</br>

It is not a gimmick or a fad.​
It is a healthy, positive and non - manipulative parenting tool that takes only a few minutes of a parent’s 
time with each one of their children, nightly.​ It is a precise method that allows parents to give over 
the normal message of their love to their child, and the message of the child’s intrinsic lovability. When 
using this proven method, those messages are accepted into their child’s subconscious, without it being 
rejected.​</br></br>

Thank you so much!
I look forward to hearing from you and I appreciate your help in spreading, what I see as,  
a game changing skill to parents.
